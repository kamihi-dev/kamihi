## Python package

Kamihi is published as a Python package on [PyPI](https://example.com). You can install it using any Python package manager, although we recommend `uv`.

=== "uv"
    ``` sh
    uv add kamihi
    ```
=== "pip"
    ``` sh
    pip install kamihi
    ```
=== "poetry"
    ``` sh
    poetry add kamihi
    ```
=== "pipenv"
    ``` sh
    pipenv install kamihi
    ```

## Next steps

Now that you have installed Kamihi, you can set the basic configuration options. Check the [configuration tutorial](configuration.md) for more information.
